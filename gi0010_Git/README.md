## We use Git! 

We use this GitLab repository to disseminate the course material. It would be best if you used a GitLab client to **clone the repository** regularly. 

### What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system for source code management. It provides a set of commands to interact with a local repository as well as a remote repository (server). **GitHub** and **GitLab** are two server implementations for Git often used as source-code-hosting facilities.


### Install a Git Client 

The are many different Git clients. The clients can be used to interact with both GitLab and GitHub. The purists use the command line interface (CLI). 

For now we recommend to install both, 
1. The CLI based  [**Git client**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and
1. the GUI based [**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/). 

### Clone the Repository

Command line: `git clone https://github.com/rolfbecker/MIE_2.02_GeoInfo_WS2021.git`

With **GitHub Desktop**:

1. Open GitHub desktop
1. Go to _File -> Clone repository ..._
1. Change to tab _URL_
1. Copy the URL `https://github.com/rolfbecker/MIE_2.02_GeoInfo_WS2021.git` into the URL field
1. Choose your local path (directory). In this directory a new directory with the repo name will be created.
1. Press button _clone_.
