# QGIS Tutorial by the Baruch College, City Univ. New York (CUNY)

The [QGIS tutorial by the Baruch College](https://guides.newman.baruch.cuny.edu/gis/gisprac) is one of the best tutorials on QGIS I know. The teaching material for **self-study** is excellent and the spectrum of methods explained covers all basic principles of geographical information systems. 

The guide [*Downloading Data for the GIS Practicum*](http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/geoportal/resources/practicum/giswkshp_download.pdf) describes how to download and extract the zip archive of the course material.

The material can be downloaded from the [*main course website*](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/confluence/display/geoportal/GIS+Practicum).
