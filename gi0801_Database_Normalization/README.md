# Database Nomalization #

My presentation for this topic is not open, yet. Students of HSRW can download it from the related Moodle course.

In the presentation the database for the fictive "For Ladies" sales company is discussed. The spreadsheet "For_Ladies_DB_Normalization_V001.xlsx" in the repo shows the decomposition (normalization) of the initial relation.
